Governor Pat McCrory continues to lag far behind his opponent for North Carolina governor, Democratic candidate and state attorney general Roy Cooper, in campaign donations.  However, the two candidates remain practically tied in the latest polls.  

Both candidates released their third quarter reports on Oct. 31, which showed Cooper extending his sizable lead in funding to $21.8 million compared to McCrory’s $13.9 million.  From July through October, Cooper raised more than $9 million from contributors, while McCrory raised $5.3 million in that same timeframe.  

“It’s — I won’t say extraordinary, but maybe unusual — that the challenger raises more money than the incumbent,” said Ferrell Guillory, a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill who teaches a Southern politics course.  

Cooper also had nearly twice the number of donations compared to the incumbent McCrory, and donors for Cooper came from every single state in the country.  Guillory called North Carolina “the battleground of battleground states,” and that’s reflected in the latest report.  The Democratic party has poured in more than $3.5 million to support Cooper’s gubernatorial bid, almost triple what the Republican party has given McCrory, in a campaign targeting an incumbent perceived as vulnerable.  

“Cooper has been able to offset the advantage of the incumbency by raising more money, which gives him more ability to put commercials on TV, to do the get out the vote organizing aspect of the campaign,” Guillory said.  

The financial advantage has also helped Cooper in the advertising war.  The attorney general has spent $17.8 million on advertising compared to $9.7 million for McCrory.  The almost $28 million spent on advertising is second in all governor’s races trailing only Missouri. 

With his deep pockets, Cooper has been able to quickly respond to attack by McCrory, such as the accusations concerning how Cooper as attorney general handled the state crime lab.  And potential voters have seen slightly more than 36,000 ads for Cooper, compared to more than 21,000 for McCrory.  

Despite the difference in funding, the race remains tight in the waning days of the campaign.  In the latest poll conducted Oct.23-27 and released by Elon University Tuesday, Cooper led McCrory 44.4 to 44.3 percent with a 3.7 percent margin for error.  The previous poll released by Elon on Oct. 4 had given Cooper a four-point lead.  

Since then, strong performances by McCrory in two televised debates have helped counter the continued controversy of House Bill 2, education policy, voting rights and negative fallout from Republican nominee Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.  McCrory’s response to Hurricane Matthew has also earned him some good will from North Carolina voters similar to how George W. Bush’s popularity rose following 9/11.  

“The incumbent always gets some attention by doing his or her job,” Guillory said. “There’s no major controversy as far as we know in the flood relief, so McCrory is getting the benefit of being the governor.”  

Guillory added he wasn’t surprised that the polls showed a razor-thin margin between the candidates given the polarized political climate in North Carolina and the state’s history of competitive elections.  He said the race had been tied all along, and the key factor on Election Day will be turnout.  

<b>Where is the money coming from?</b>  

Looking at a heatmap of the top 1000 donations for each candidate weighted by amount, it’s clear Cooper’s donations are heavily concentrated in the urban areas of the state, like Charlotte, Greensboro, Asheville and Durham.  Though McCrory has received some donations from those urban areas, particularly Raleigh, most of his donations are spread out in the more rural areas of the state.

McCrory has done well in eastern North Carolina, which was the most heavily affected by Hurricane Matthew, and has a heavy concentration of donations from Fayetteville totaling more than $111,000.  He’s also done stronger than Cooper in the area surrounding New Bern and the far western parts of the state, including Asheville.

But while McCrory hasn’t done poorly in Charlotte, where he was the mayor from 1995-2009, Cooper’s reach has extended further up both I-85 and I-77.  Hickory, a town where the economy has been heavily impacted by the withdrawal of the furniture manufacturing industry, has donated $47,000 to Cooper’s campaign compared to around $25,000 for McCrory.  

Greensboro has been a major fundraising win for the Cooper campaign, with more than $287,000 raised compared to just over $100,000 in the city for McCrory.  Durham, Chapel Hill and Cary also combined to contribute nearly $900,000 to Cooper’s campaign.  

Donations aren’t necessarily a prediction of how certain areas will vote.  There were around 46,000 donations between both Cooper and McCrory in the third quarter, which, even if assuming each donation is equal to one unique individual, is only 0.7 percent of the 6.9 million people eligible to vote in North Carolina.  But it is reflective of a late October poll by Siena College showing higher Democratic votes in urban areas where Cooper is drawing most of his financial support.  

Whether Cooper’s deep pockets and strong presence in North Carolina’s population centers are enough to propel him to victory remain to be seen.  Despite the financial disadvantage and negative national attention due to HB2, McCrory’s defense of the bill has not alienated his base which helped him win by a landslide in 2012.  He’s been able to fall back on the economic growth he’s overseen in the state, offsetting to an extent what was lost in HB2’s fallout.  He’s setting up for a bitter final battle that will likely drag late into Tuesday night before a winner finally emerges.
